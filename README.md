# GitWise AI

> Your open-source GitHub companion — it triages issues, catches bad PRs before they merge, helps newcomers find their first contribution, and writes your README for you. No paid APIs. Ever.

---

## What is GitWise AI?

Maintaining an open-source project is hard. Issues pile up unlabeled, duplicates slip through, new contributors get lost, and documentation always falls behind. GitWise AI was built to fix all of that in one place.

Connect it to GitHub via OAuth and it quietly goes to work:

- **Maintainers** stop drowning in issue noise — every new issue gets classified, scored for priority, and checked against existing ones automatically.
- **New contributors** get a personalized feed of issues that actually match their skill level, so they can start contributing without digging through hundreds of tickets.
- **Repository owners** can generate a complete, professional README from their codebase in seconds instead of hours.
- **Everyone** gets a clear explanation with a direct link to the exact line of code whenever a PR or commit gets flagged — no silent failures, ever.

Everything runs on `gpt-oss-120B`, a fully open-source model you can self-host. No OpenAI. No Anthropic. No per-token bill.

## What it Can Do

| Feature | What it actually does |
|---|---|
| Issue Triage | Reads every new issue and classifies it, checks for duplicates, scores its priority, and suggests or applies labels — no human needed |
| PR & Commit Moderation | Scans code diffs and commit messages for security holes, hardcoded secrets, policy violations, and sloppy messages before anything merges |
| AI Block Notifications | When something gets blocked, the bot posts a detailed comment on GitHub explaining exactly why, with a clickable link to the specific line of code |
| First Issue Recommender | Scores open issues by how well they match a contributor's skills, experience level, and interests — surfaces the ones most likely to be a good fit |
| README Generator | Parses your repo's structure, dependencies, and scripts, then generates a full README draft ready to preview and export |
| Dashboard | One place to see your triage results, moderation history, and contributor recommendations across all monitored repositories |

## Getting Started

The whole thing should be running locally in under 10 minutes. Here's what you'll need before you start:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub OAuth App — [create one here](https://github.com/settings/developers), it takes about 2 minutes
- A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account for the database
- A free [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io) account for the vector store
- A free [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) account with access to `gpt-oss-120B`

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gitwise-ai.git
cd gitwise-ai
```

### 2. Set up your environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your credentials:

```env
# GitHub OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=

# Database
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Vector Database
QDRANT_URL=
QDRANT_API_KEY=

# AI Model
GPT_OSS_MODEL_ENDPOINT=
GPT_OSS_MODEL_API_KEY=

# App
FRONTEND_URL=
BACKEND_URL=
SESSION_SECRET=
```

### 3. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_migrations.py
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 4. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will be live at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Connect your first webhook

With the backend running, head to your repository's **Settings → Webhooks** and add a new one:

- **Payload URL:** `https://your-backend-url/webhooks/github`
- **Content type:** `application/json`
- **Secret:** whatever you set as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your `.env`
- **Events:** Issues, Pull requests, Push, Issue comments, Pull request review comments

## How People Use It

### Maintainer — Keeping Issues Under Control

1. Connect GitHub via OAuth and pick which repositories to monitor
2. GitWise AI registers webhooks and backfills all your existing open issues on first run
3. From that point on, every new issue that comes in gets classified, scored, and checked for duplicates automatically
4. Labels are applied or queued for your review — whichever you prefer
5. If something's a duplicate or spam, the bot posts a comment on GitHub explaining why so the author isn't left guessing
6. Check the dashboard any time to see the full triage picture across all your repos

### Contributor — Submitting a Pull Request

1. Open a Pull Request on any monitored repository
2. GitWise AI picks up the webhook, pulls the diff, and runs it through the moderation pipeline
3. If something's wrong: a bot comment goes up on the PR immediately — with the exact reason, the file name, the line number, and a clickable link right to that line on GitHub
4. If everything looks good: the commit status flips to ✅ success and the PR is clear to review

### New Contributor — Finding the Right First Issue

1. Log in with GitHub OAuth
2. Fill out a quick skill profile — languages, frameworks, how long you've been coding
3. Get back a ranked list of open issues that actually match what you know, with a short explanation for each match
4. Bookmark the ones that interest you and jump straight to GitHub when you're ready

### Repository Owner — Generating Documentation

1. Pick a connected repository or paste in any public repo URL
2. GitWise AI parses the folder structure, dependencies, and scripts
3. `gpt-oss-120B` writes a complete README — title, description, install steps, usage, API reference, contributing guide, license
4. Preview and tweak it, then export the markdown or let GitWise AI open a PR with it directly

## Edge Cases We've Thought About

- **Empty repository** — shows a clean empty state; README generation still works fine even with no issues.
- **Binary-only PR diff** — nothing to analyze, so the PR gets an automatic pass with a note explaining why.
- **Non-English comments** — language detection runs first so the model doesn't mistakenly flag a perfectly reasonable comment just because it's not in English.
- **Contributor submits no skill profile** — the recommendation engine falls back to popularity signals: star count, `good first issue` labels, and recent activity.
- **Large repositories with thousands of issues** — imports are paginated and processed in batches of 50 to avoid timeouts and rate limits.
- **Duplicate webhook deliveries** — GitHub occasionally sends the same event twice; the `X-GitHub-Delivery` header is used as an idempotency key so the same event is never processed more than once.
- **AI inference endpoint is down** — code moderation fails open (the PR is not blocked) so contributors aren't punished for infrastructure issues. The failure is logged and the maintainer is notified.
- **Maintainer wants to override a block** — there's a dedicated override button in the dashboard that dismisses the block and records who overrode it and when.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here's how:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes — add tests where it makes sense.
3. Open a Pull Request and describe what changed and why.

GitWise AI will automatically review the PR when you open it. Practice what we preach.
